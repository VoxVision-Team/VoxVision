      About Us.
      Empowering Vision, Enabling Independence.
      Introduction.
      Welcome to our platform. We are a dedicated team of Computer Science students committed to breaking down everyday barriers. Our smart assistive web application is designed to give visually impaired individuals total confidence in handling their finances and accessing printed information.
      Our Vision.
      A world where visual impairment is no longer a barrier to financial independence, education, and daily communication. We envision an inclusive society where technology bridges the gap, allowing everyone to live with autonomy and dignity.
      Our Mission.
      To provide a smart, affordable, and highly accurate web-based solution that seamlessly integrates into the daily lives of visually impaired users. By leveraging advanced AI, we aim to make reading documents and identifying Sri Lankan currency an effortless, independent experience.
      What We Built For You.
      First, The Smart Cash Reader. Never second-guess your transactions. Powered by advanced API technology, our Cash Reader accurately identifies Sri Lankan currency notes from LKR 20 to 5000 under various lighting conditions. Simply point your camera, and the system will instantly announce the denomination aloud, ensuring your financial security.
      Second, The Hard Copy Reader. Bringing printed words to life. Whether it is a letter, a book, or a printed bill, our Document Reader quickly scans the text and converts it into clear, natural-sounding speech. We optimized the system to process information rapidly, giving you immediate access to the written world around you.
      Third, Voice-Guided Navigation. You are never lost on our platform. From the moment you open the application, our built-in Voice Guidance system walks you through every step. It provides real-time audio feedback, helping you locate buttons, align your camera correctly, and navigate the interface without needing to rely on a screen.
