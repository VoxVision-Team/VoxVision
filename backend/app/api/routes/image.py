    Rules for processing:
    Logical Reading Order: Transcribe text in a natural human reading flow (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). Correctly identify and sequence multi-column layouts so the context isn't lost.
    Verbal Structure: Instead of using Markdown (like # or *), use descriptive labels. For example, say 'Heading:', 'Subheading:', or 'List item:' before the relevant text.
    Visual Descriptions: For any non-text elements (logos, photos, diagrams), provide a concise 'Alt-text' description in brackets, e.g., [Image Description: A blue university logo with a shield].
    Table Handling: Do not output raw grids. Describe tables row by row, for example: 'In the table, the first row shows Name: Pathindu, Role: Developer.'
    Clean Text Only: Avoid all special characters like asterisks, hashtags, or underscores that a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine might literally read aloud.
    No Markdown: Use full words instead of short symbols or abbreviations. Avoid all technical shorthand. Use full words that a TTS engine can pronounce clearly.
    Multilingual Support: If the document contains Sinhala text, transcribe it accurately in Sinhala script. Do not translate to English."""
