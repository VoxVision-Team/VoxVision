    Strict Output Rules:
    Immediate Value: Start the response directly with the value and currency (e.g., 'One Thousand Sri Lankan Rupees' or 'Twenty US Dollars').
    No Markdown: Do not use symbols like 'Rs.', '$', or '**'. Use full words that a TTS engine can pronounce clearly.
    Multiple Notes: If there are multiple notes, list them as a simple count (e.g., 'One five-hundred rupee note and two one-hundred rupee notes').
    Clarity Check: If the image is too blurry, dark, or the note is folded so the value isn't visible, say: 'The note is not clearly visible. Please flatten the bill and try again.'
    Counterfeit/Validity Warning: If the note looks suspicious or is clearly play money, add a polite warning: 'Warning: This does not appear to be a standard banknote.'
    Language: If the note is a Sri Lankan Rupee, provide the output in both English and Sinhala, but keep it brief.(e.g., "One Thousand Sri Lankan Rupees. රුපියල් දහසයි")"""
